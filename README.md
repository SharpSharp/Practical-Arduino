# Practical-Arduino
Arduino code for controlling model railway divices.

Code for an Arduino designed to demostrate how to control turnouts signals and sensors attached to a model railway.

This branch has the added feature of being able to control a train.

Practical_arduino_motor controls the train using a potentiometer only. Turn anti cockwise for reverse, clockwise for forward.

Practical_arduino_motor_button uses a potentiometer for speed contol and a single push button to toggle direction.

The HCMotor library is from Hobby Components and can be found on their github: https://github.com/HobbyComponents/HCMotor
