# Practical-Arduino
Arduino code for controlling model railway divices.

Code for an Arduino designed to demostrate how to control turnouts signals and sensors attached to a model railway.

Practical_arduino_millis removes delays() from the code and works with the millis() function.

Practical_arduino_basic_array uses millis(). Variables have been transfered into arrays to enable up to 12 servos to be drvien on an Uno or Nano and on a Mega the limit is 48.
